# HabitHub 🌱

A sleek and simple web app to build — and keep — healthy habits.  
Track your routines, stay consistent, and watch your progress grow, day by day.

Built entirely in the browser using **F#**, **Fable**, and **Elmish**.

## ✨ Motivation

As a student balancing studies, hobbies, and health, staying consistent is hard — especially when life gets chaotic.  
I wanted a tool that doesn’t just remind me of goals, but makes tracking **simple**, **visual**, and even a little fun.

**HabitHub** was born from that need — distraction-free space to monitor your daily habits and celebrate progress.


This is a project which I am still working on.
